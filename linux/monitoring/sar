System Activity Reporter

I- Installation  and Configuration

1) Installation
yum install sysstat

2) 24-hour Time  
alias sar = 'LANG=C sar'
Note: add alias entry in ~/.bashrc or /etc/bashrc for persistence

3) Configuration
Config file          : /etc/sysconfig/sysstat
HISTORY=<day_number> : number of days to archive sar data
/var/log/sa/sadd     : sar daily data file dd are day of month 
SADC_OPTIONS="-S X " : system activity data collector options where X=INT,DISK,SNMP,IPV6,POWER,XDISK,ALL,XALL 

4) General Command Options

sar [options] [ interval [ count ]
    
    -A   : record all
    -o   : save output to file
    -f   : read from file    

5) Cron Configuration

Set by default to collect sysstat data every 10 minutes
Cron file           : /etc/cron.d/sysstat 

II- CPU & Scheduler 

1) CPU Usage

sar -u -P ALL  ( -P: specify processor number, ALL : all fields )
 
  %user   =  user time + virtual processor.
  %usr    =  user time
  %nice   =  cpu usage for nice application
  %system =  kernel time + irq time
  %sys    =  kernel time
  %iowait =  IO wait time
  %steal  =  hypervisor stealed cpu 
  %irq    =  irq time

2) Queue Status

sar -q    

 runq-sz    = run queue length (number of runnable task) 
 plist-sz   = number of tasks in the task list
 ldavg-1    = load average for last minute
 ldavg-5    = load average for last 5  minute
 ldavg-15   = load average for last 15 minute
 blocked    = number of task blocked waiting for I/O
                     

3) Context Switch

sar -w 
 
 proc/s      = number of tasks created per second.
 cswch/s     = number of context switches per second.

4) Interrupts

sar -I {int [,..] | SUM |ALL|XALL}

 intr/s     = interrupt per second

III- Memory

1) Memory Usage

sar -r
 
 kbmemfree  = free memory in KiB
 kbmemused  = used memory in KiB (execluding kernel)
 kbbuffers  = buffer cache in KiB
 kbcached   = page cache in KiB
 %commit    = percentage of memory needed for current workload over VM (RAM+Swap)
 kbactive   = active   list memory in kiB
 kbinact    = inactive list memory in KiB
 kbdirty    = dirty memory in KiB
  
2) Memory Stat

sar -R

 frpg/s      = memory pages freed (negative indicates allocations) per second
 bufpg/s     = buffer cache page additions per second
 campg/s     = page cache page allocations per second

3) Hugepages

sar -H

  kbhugfree  = hugepages in KiB not allocated
  kbhugused  = hugepages in KiB allocated
  %hugused   = % of used hugepages

4) Paging

sar -B

  pgpgin/s   = amount of memory in KiB paged in from disk
  pgpgout/s  = amount of memory in KiB paged out to  disk
  fault/s    = number of faults (minor+major) per second 
  majflt/s   = number of major faults per second
  pgfree/s   = pages added to free list per second

5) Swapping

sar -W

 pswpin/s    = number of pages swapped-out per second
 pswout/s    = number of pages swapped-in  per second

sar -S
 
 kbswpfree  = free swap space in KiB
 kbswpused  = used swap space in KiB
 kbswpcad   = cached swap space (Mem+Swap) can be paged-out without disk I/O in KiB
 
IV- Network

sar -n DEV  : network interface statistics
 rxpkt/s    = received    packets per second    
 txpkt/s    = transmitted packets per second
 rxkB/s     = received    kilobytes per second
 txkB/s     = transmitted kilobytes per second

sar -n EDEV : network interface errors
 rxerr/s    = received packet errors per second
 txerr/s    = transmitted packet errors per second
 coll/s     = collisions packets per second
 rxdrop/s   = received packets dropped (buffer full) per second
 txdrop/s   = transmitted packets dropped (buffer full) per second
 rxfifo/s   = received packets FIFO overrun errors  per second
 txfifo/s   = transmitted packets FIFO overrun errors per second

sar -n IP   : IP datagram statistics
 irec/s     = input datagrams (received) per second
 fwddgm/s   = forwarded datagrams per second
 orq/s      = output datagram requests (transmit) per second

sar -n EIP  : IP error statistics
 idisc/s    = input discards (e.g., buffer full) datagrams per second
 odisc/s    = output discards (e.g., buffer full) datagrams per second

sar -n TCP  : TCP statistics
 active/s   = new active TCP connections (connect()) connections per second
 passive/s  = new passive TCP connections (listen()) connections per second
 iseg/s     = input segments (received) segments per second
 oseg/s     = output segments (sent) segments per second

sar -n ETCP : TCP error statistics
 atmptf/s   = active TCP connection fails per second
 retrans/s  = TCP segments retransmitted per second

sar -n SOCK : Socket usage
 totsck     = total sockets in use
