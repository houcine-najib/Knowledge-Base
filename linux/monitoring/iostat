Device Metrics

tps             =  transfers      per second.
Blk_read/s      =  blocks read    per second.
Blk_wrtn/s      =  blocks written per second.
Blk_read        =  blocks read    during the interval.
Blk_wrtn        =  blocks written during the interval.

Extended Statistics 

rrqm/s          = reads  merged before issued to the disk.
wrqm/s          = writes merged before issued to the disk.
r/s             = reads  issued to the disk per second.
w/s             = writes issued to the disk per second.
rsec/s          = sectors read per second.
wsec/s          = sectors written per second.
rkB/s           = kilobytes read from disk per second.
wkB/s           = kilobytes written to disk per second.
avgrq-sz        = average size (in sectors) of disk requests.
avgqu-sz        = average size of the disk request queue.
await           = average time for disk request complete (queue + svctm) in ms
svctm           = average service time in ms
