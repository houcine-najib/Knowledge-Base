vmstat  : virtula memory statistics

vmstat -s              : list all statictics since boot
vmstat [delay [count]] : output each delay seconds for count times. 
vmstat -n              : remove periodic headers.
vmstat -a              : print active/inactive memory.
vmstat -p <partition>  : print disk partition device stats.
vmstat -d              : print disk stats.(-D sumary)
vmstat -m              : print slabinfo.
vmstat -w              : wide output.
