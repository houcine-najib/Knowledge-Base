The switch between different processes is called a context switch,

because when it happens, the CPU saves all the context information from the old

process and retrieves all the context information for the new process

the context switches are most likely caused by an I/O request or some

other long-running system call (such as a sleep).

Voluentary Context Switch : Requested by the process blocked by I/O
Non-Voluentary Context Switch : Caused by kernel timer interrupt to schedule another process
