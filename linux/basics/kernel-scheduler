I- Context Switch 

The switch between different processes the CPU saves all the context information from the old process 
and retrieves all the context information for the new process.
Too much context switching is undesirable because the processor has to flush its register and cache 

Voluentary Context Switch     : Requested by the process blocked by I/O
Non-Voluentary Context Switch : Caused by kernel timer interrupt to schedule another process

II- Scheduling and Preemption

Scheduling of processes on CPU is performed by the kernel scheduler from per-priority runnables threads queues : run queues

Preemption of processes off CPU based on static or dynamic process priority.  

Kernel Preemption support allows high-priority user-level threads to interrupt the kernel and execute.

Timeslice is period for which a process will be running before it is preempted. 

III- Process Priority

Scheduler evalutes non-realtime process priority in scheduling and preemption.

Static  : defined by user-space through NICE.
Dynamic : calculated by the kerenl based on policy.

realtime prcoess have static priority which always higher than non-realtime ones.

IV- Process Types :

CPU Bound : perform heavy compute           : run less frequently for long  time intervals
I/O Bound : perform I/O with little compute : run very frequently for short time intervals

V- Scheduling Policies :

Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) is the default Linux kernel scheduler.

CFS contain scheduling classes. These classes are modular and represent scheduling policies

/proc/sched_debug : Scheduler Debugging
/proc/PID/sched   : Per Process Scheduler Statistics
 
Latency     = Delay between the time a process is scheduled to run and the actual process execution.
Granularity = ( latency / NORT ) - ( latencty / NORT / NORT ) where NORT : is the number of running tasks.

CFS parameters : sysctl or /proc/sys/kernel

                                                                                                 sched-design-CFS.txt

sched_latency_ns             = delay between process scheduling and execution
                             = scheduler run a task  from the queue once  during the epoch 
                             = sched_min_granularity_ns * number_of_running_tasks : if too many tasks on system (*)
                               (*) number_of_runnable_tasks > sched_latency_ns/sched_min_granularity_ns

sched_min_granularity_ns     = granularity of sched_latency_ns  

sched_wakeup_granularity_ns  = wake-up preemption,ability for woken tasks with higher priority to preemt current running task
                               High : reduces wake-up preemption, reducing disturbance of compute bound tasks.
                               Lower: improves wake-up latency and throughput for latency critical tasks.
sched_migration_cost_ns      =  If the real run time of the task is less than this value, 
                                then the scheduler will assume that it is still in cache and
                                will try to avoid moving the task to another CPU.
                                Reduce: if high CPU idle with runnable tasks
                                Increase: if tasks bounce between CPUs/Nodes too often

sched_rt_period_us           = period over which real-time tasks measured. Default: 1,000,000 µs                         
sched_rt_runtime_us          = quantum allocated to real-time tasks during sched_rt_period_us (default: 950,000 µs)
                             = -1 disable : no time for non-rt task
                                0         : no time for rt tasks

sched_rt_period_us - sched_rt_runtime_us = time for non-real time tasks.

sched_rr_timeslice_ms        = round robin time quanta for SCHED_RR tasks 

Real Time Policies:

SCHED_FIFO =  Run until blocked by I/O or preempted by higher-priority process.
SCHED_RR   =  Round-Robin scheduling policy. Processes at the same priority level are only allowed to run for a maximum time quantum.

Both SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR may be used concurrently for different running processes.

Non-Real Time Policies: 

SCHED_OTHER = SCHED_NORMAL default round-robin style  time-sharing scheduling policy (majority of processes).
SCHED_BATCH = does not pre-empt nearly as often as SCHED_NORMAL does, so the tasks run longer and make better use of caches.
SCHED_IDLE  = very low priority processes priority lower than nice 19

Note: threads with this policy are considered to have a realtime priority of 0 .

Setting or Changing Process Priority : 

Non-Real Time : nice/renice  

nice -n <-20..19> <command> 
renice  <-20..19> <PID>

Real-Time     : chrt          

chrt -m = minimum and maximum valid priorities for each scheduling algorithm.

chrt <scheduler> <priority> <command>

chrt -p  <scheduler> <priority> <PID>

-b = SCHED_BATCH
-f = SCHED_FIFO
-i = SCHED_IDLE
-o = SCHED_OTHER
-r = SCHED_RR     = DEFAULT (if <scheduler> not set)

VI- Systemd Scheduling
Set systemd units CPU scheduling policy and priority
#
CPUSchedulingPolicy      = other, batch, idle,fifo or rr
CPUSchedulingPriority    = 1 lowest .. 99 highest 

only RT Policies rr,fifo can set priority , others have static priority set to 0

CPUSchedulingPolicy and CPUShares/CPUAccounting cannot be set together (for RT units only) last will set cpuset cgroup attribute cpu.rt_runtime_us to 0 disabling any realtime task
