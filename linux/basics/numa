Uniform Memory Access (UMA)     : symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) 
Each CPU has uniform access latency to all of memory, via a shared system bus.

Non-Uniform Memory Access(NUMA) : 
Each CPU has a dedicated area of memory combained referred to as NUMA  Node.

/sys/devices/system/node : NUMA nodes infos , and relative distances between those nodes.
Example : per node hugepages   : cat /sys/devices/system/node/*/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/*
          NUMA stat            : cat /sys/devices/system/node/*/numastat
          per node memory info : cat /sys/devices/system/node/*/meminfo
          
Node Distance : hardcoded values set by motherboard manufacturer exposed to OS by ACPI to determine the relative distance
between any 2 NUMA nodes 
Distances range from 10 (fastest) to 254 (25.4 slower) 255 for no NUMA connection.
#
numastat : tool for  memory statistics on a per-NUMA-node basis. 
	    numa_hit       : number of pages that were successfully allocated to this node.
	    numa_miss      : number of pages that were allocated on this node because of low memory on the intended node.
	    numa_foreign   : number of pages initially intended for this node that were allocated to another node instead. 
	    interleave_hit : number of interleave policy pages successfully allocated to this node.
	    local_node     : number of pages successfully allocated on this node, by a process on this node.
	    other_node     : number of pages allocated on this node, by a process on another node.

numastat -m                    : cat /sys/devices/system/node/*/meminfo
numastat -p <PID> or <pattern> :  per-node process memory usage (in MBs) for <PID> or list of process <pattern> 
#
numactl  : set the processor affinity and memory affinity of a process.

 --hardware    = inventory of available nodes on the system, including relative distances between nodes.
 --membind     = process allocate memory from specific node.           Syntax: numactl --membind=<nodes> <process> 
 --cpunodebind = process and childs execute only on the specified node.Syntax: numactl --cpunodebind=<nodes> <process>
 --phycpubind  = process and childs execute only on the specified CPU .Syntax: numactl --phycpubind=<cpus> <process>
 --localalloc  = process  memory should always be allocated from the local node.
 --preferred   = preferred node from which to allocate memory.
 --show        = current process NUMA policy.
#
NUMA Load Balancing : 
#
sysctl kernel.numa_balancing=enable/disable ( enabled by default : /proc/sys/kernel/numa_balancing) 
kernel boot commandline : numa_balancing=enable/disable
kernel boot commandline : numa=off (completly disbale numa)
#
numad        NUMA affinity management daemon dynamically improve NUMA resource allocation.
               = -i time interval that numad waits between system scans,default 15s.
                  with systemd unit interval can be changed in /etc/numad.conf
Note: numad disbale numa load balancing

numad -i 0          = stop numad (does not remove changes).
numad -S 0 -p <PID> = restrict numad to process with PID.(-p <PID-n>)
numad -S 1          = scan all system processes except exclusion list.
