There are a total of 140 priorities and two distinct priority ranges implemented in Linux.
The first one is nice value (niceness) which ranges from -20 (highest priority value) to 19 (lowest priority value) and the default is  0,

this is what we will uncover in this guide. 
The other is the real-time priority, which ranges from 1 to 99 by default, then 100 to 139 are meant for user-space.

top
NI      Nice value (user-space) -19 .. 20
PR/PRI  Processâ€™s actual priority (kernel-space) rt:process under RT policies 

ps
RTPRIO  NI PRI

Total number of priorities = 140
Real time priority range(PR or PRI):  0 to 99 
User space priority range: 100 to 139

Nice value range (NI): -20 to 19

PR = 20 + NI
PR = 20 + (-20 to + 19)
PR = 20 + -20  to 20 + 19
PR = 0 to 39 which is same as 100 to 139.
