# Units Types
service : service or application
socket  : network/IPC socket or FIFO buffer associated with service file
device  : udev/sysfs device
mount   : mountpoints (units are entries of /etc/fstab)
automount 
swap    : swap space (device/file path)
target  : 
path    :
timer   : schedule activation (cron job)
snapshot: revert to current state after changing (systemctl snapshot ,session based temporary)
slice   : linux control goup nodes , manage resources of set of processes(service/scope) default :root,user,system
          to create child slice of parent parent-child.slice (E.g: system-flops.slice)
scope   : externally created system process

# Drop-ins and snippets
Unit extension , create directory with unit-name.d and files with .conf extension to override or extend the unit

# Create transient scope/service unit marked as static(without configuration file)
systemd-run --unit=name --scope --slice=slice_name command
name    = unit name
--scope = foreground (Default service in background)
--slice = slice(new) default(system)

#Remove transient unit
systemctl stop name.service
systemctl kill name.service --kill-who=PID,... --signal=signal
--kill-who (Optional) = select processes from cgroup to terminate
--signal   (Optional) = select signal default SIGTERM

# Modify Systemd units

# On the fly
# Documentation in man systemc.resource-control
systemctl set-property  --runtime unit-name property=value
--runtime (Optional) = make non-persistent change to persistent  units
--runtime (Mandatory)= make change to transient units

# Edit Unit file
systemclt  daemon-reload
systemclt  restart <unit_name>.<unit_type>

# CPU Configuration for Systemd Unit

CPUAccounting    = true/false (true for all units in slice and slice parents)
CPUShares        = weight of cpu (defaults 1024) at runtime and startup (if StartupCPUShares set)
StartupCPUShares = weight of cpu on startup only
CPUQuota         = % of CPU time (> 100 more than one cpu)

Note: for systemd unit(slice,scope,service) with : CPUAccounting=true
      other cpu options (*) are in /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/<parent>.slice/<parent-child>.slice/<service_name>.service

Warning: for services under system slice only ones under /usr/lib/systemd/system will have directory.

# RAM Configuration for Systemd Unit

MemoryAccounting = true/false (true for all units in slice and slice parents)
MemoryLimit      = Limit of memory in bytes

Note: for systemd unit(slice,scope,service) with : MemoryAccounting=true
      other memory options (*) are in /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/<parent>.slice/<parent-child>.slice/<service_name>.service

# Block I/O Configuration for Systemd Unit

BlockIOAccounting     = true/false (true for all units in slice and slice parents)
BlockIOWeight         = weight (block IO between 10 & 1000:default)
StartupBlockIOWeight  = weight (at startup)
BlockIODeviceWeight   = device (dev path,file path) weight(between 10 & 1000)
BlockIOReadBandwidth  = device (dev path,file path:backing dev)  bytes (bytes:K,M,G per second) **Buffer Support**
BlockIOWriteBandwidth = device bytes **No Buffer Support**

Note: for systemd unit(slice,scope,service) with : BlockIOAccounting=true 
      other blkio options (*) are in /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio/<parent>.slice/<parent-child>.slice/<service_name>.service

# Task Configuration for Systemd Unit

TasksAccounting = true/false (keep track of unit tasks ,true for all units in slice and slice parents)
TasksMax       = Number of threads(kernel and usespace) or % of system max tasks 

# Other Configuration for CGroup Systemd Unit 

DeviceAllow    = device_name(path or group in /proc/devices) options(r,w,m:create)
DevicePolicy   = auto   (default allow access to all devices)
                 closed (allow only pseudo devices :/dev/null,/dev/zero..)
                 strict (allow access specified by DeviceAllow)
Slice          = slice name default is system
ExecStartPost  = command used to modify other unsupported features by systemd
               = /bin/bash -c "echo <parameter> > /sys/fs/cgroup/<resource_controller>/<slice>/<subsystem>/<parameter_file>"

# CPU 
Nice                     = Nice level (scheduling priority) -20 (highest) ... 19 (lowest)
CPUAffinity              = Space-Separated list of CPU
CPUSchedulingPolicy      = other, batch, idle,fifo or rr
CPUSchedulingPriority    = 1 lowest .. 99 highest (RT Policy)
CPUSchedulingResetOnFork = Reset CPU Scheduling on process fork

# Memory
OOMScoreAdjust   = Set Out-Of-Memeory Score -1000 (Disabled)... 1000(High OOM likelihood)

# I/O Scheduling Class/Priority 
IOSchedulingClass     =  0 or none, 1 or realtime, 2 or best-effort, 3 or idle
IOSchedulingPriority  =  0 : Highest .. 7 Lowest

# Monitor CGroup

systemd-cgls   = dislay hierarchy of cgroups (provide CGroup path as an option)
systemd-cgls   = cpu    (service that interact with cpu controller)
                 memory (memory controller)
                 blkio  (block IO controller)

systemd-cgtop  = top like resources consumption for cgroups

systemctl -t slice
